A simple project to practice a few git/github workflows.  Replace the contents of this file with the contents indicated in the [instructions](./instructions.md).

Here is the article that I found interesting [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-with-the-best-engineering-teams-according-to-employees-comparably-2021-4)

I find this article interesting because it allowed me to get an inside look at some of the work that is out there and availible to software engineers! I think reading this article excited me and motivatde me to do some interview preperation as it made me excited at the thought of working in industry. Reading this quote made me curious as to what it would be like to work at Google. > We are a big team and we all help each other out. Everyone is friendly and helpful. Could not ask for more from my coworkers and teams.
